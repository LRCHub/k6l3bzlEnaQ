黎明之前被黑暗攻陷 照亮緊閉的雙眼
輕輕撫摸時間的無奈 如此荒涼又溫暖
Everyday I care
Everyday I fail
Everyday that moment is over
Everyday you track
Everyday you sense when you wake up this morning
You will see I had a strange dream really

如同我們想起了以後 在我沉睡的時候
如同我們想忘了以後 畫框裡我們還牽著手
Everyday I care
Everyday I fail
Everyday that moment is over
Everyday you track
Everyday you sense when you wake up this morning
You will see I have been strange

我早已忘記的夏天
在變成黑白片的空間裡遊蕩
我的手 你的臉 開一地陌生花
灑落滿天的式微
Everyday I care
Everyday I fail
Everyday that moment is over

Everyday I care
Everyday I fail
Everyday that moment is over
Everyday you track
Everyday you sense

Everyday I care
Everyday I fail
Everyday that moment is over
Everyday you track
Everyday you sense
When you wake up this morning
You will see I have been strange

When you wake up this morning
You will see I have been strange already
